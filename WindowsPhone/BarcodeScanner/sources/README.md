If you wish to compile BarcodeScanner from sources, attach both projects to your solution and reference ZXingVer1_7 to BarcodeScanner, and your app to BarcodeScanner.

Bugfixes and implementation of 'encode' method is welcome ( i didn't need it so i didn't make it )

BarcodeScanner sources are free to use. ZXingVer1_7 has its own license in source files.

Have fun.
