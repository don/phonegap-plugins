# HeadsetWatcher plugin for Cordova/Phonegap #
By Matt Kane / Triggertrap Ltd. 

This plugin allows you to watch for headphones being plugged or unplugged from a device.
It does this by registering for ACTION_HEADSET_PLUG notifications.


## Adding the Plugin to your project ##

1. To install the plugin, move HeadsetWatcher.js to your project's www folder and include a reference to it in your html files.
2. Create a folder called 'com/triggertrap/' within your project's src folder.
3. And copy the HeadsetWatcher.java file into that new folder.
4. In your res/xml/plugins.xml file add the following line:

    `<plugin name="HeadsetWatcher" value="com.triggertrap.HeadsetWatcher"/>`

## Using the plugin ##

There is a single method to call: `HeadsetWatcher.watch(callback)`. 
The callback is a function, which is passed an object with the single boolean 
property `plugged`, which indicates whether the headset is currently plugged in. 
It is a persistent callback, and will be called whenever the action occurs.
The callback will also be called immediately when first registered.

The static property HeadsetWatcher.plugged is also set once watch has been called.

```javascript
 
  HeadsetWatcher.watch(function(result) {
    if(result.plugged) {
      alert("The headphones have been plugged in!");
    } else {
      alert("The headphones have been unplugged!");
    }

  })


```
